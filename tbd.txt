You're given a vector of vectors of words, e.g.: 
[['quick', 'lazy'], ['brown', 'black', 'grey'], ['fox', 'dog']]. 

Write a generalized function that prints all combinations of one word from the first vector, one word from the second vector, etc.
NOTE: the number of vectors and number of elements within each vector may vary.

For the input above, it should print (in any order): 
quick brown fox 
quick brown dog 
quick black fox 
quick black dog
